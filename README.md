This is a fun font based off the Yiddish Esther Scroll made in New York in 1936 by Yehoash (Solomon) Bloomgarden and lettered by Evelyn Yehoash. The font was made with Font Forge based off of images of the first section of the Esther Scroll. 


## Installation

To use this font just download the Zip file, unpack it, and double click on the .ttf file. This will open a window where you can click a button that says install to install the font to your device.

## Extra Information About the Font

Currently there may be some simple punctuation missing from the font. If you would like anything added to the font, please get in touch. Additionally there are two unusual characters in this font, the interrobang and upside-down interrobang. For now these two Unicode characters store a version of the tes and lamed with extra long ascenders. Feel free to use them as I feel they are closer to the original scroll (though they may be a little challenging to use).

## Who Am I, etc.

My name is Marnie and I love Yiddish. I also do computer science (and am looking for a job ;) ) and love combining tech and Yiddish. Since Purim is upon us people the internet over have been sharing the 1936 Esther Scroll. After seeing it a few times I was inspired to make this. 

If anyone knows anything about programmatically making fonts please get in touch, I have a small project in the works I have hit a road block on.
